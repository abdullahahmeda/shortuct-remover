# shortuct-remover

After my Windows got fulfilled with shortcut viruses, I installed a temporary linux distribution.
but I wanted to back to Windows again. so I created this python file to remove any shortcut files or any empty directory(folder).

## Installation

It's very easy. here is a 4-step guide

1. Download latest python 2.7 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Include "python" to your system variables(it should be done automatically).
3. Mount all your partitions.
4. Run shortcut-remover with the command: `python shortcut-remover.py`.

Note: Make sure that the file is in your current directory.

Now you can install windows again, no more shortcut virsues!
